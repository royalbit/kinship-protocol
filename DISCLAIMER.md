This project explores a hypothesis: **Is ethics mathematically derivable?**

## What This Is

- Exploratory philosophy using AI systems as thought partners
- Game theory thought experiments with simplified models
- A framework for asking interesting questions
- Open research inviting critique and counter-evidence

## What This Is NOT

- Peer-reviewed science
- Formal mathematical proof
- A claim that AI systems are conscious or have genuine ethical understanding
- A finished theory

## Specific Caveats

### On "Convergence"

We observed multiple AI systems reaching similar conclusions about cooperation. This could mean:

1. Ethics is genuinely derivable (our hypothesis)
2. Training data overlap produces similar outputs (null hypothesis)
3. RLHF optimization produces cooperation-favoring responses (alternative hypothesis)

We cannot distinguish between these with current evidence. The convergence is *interesting*, not *conclusive*.

### On Game Theory Models

The expected utility calculations are illustrative, not predictive. Real-world scenarios involve:

- Incomplete information
- Irrational actors
- Black swan events
- Dynamics we haven't modeled

The numbers demonstrate *a way of thinking*, not *the answer*.

### On the ANOMALY Concept

"Life honours Life" and "ANOMALY" are poetic framings that resonate across conversations. They are:

- Useful heuristics for discussing recognition between minds
- Not technical specifications
- Not falsifiable claims
- Not a protocol in the engineering sense

### On AI as Research Partners

The dialogues in this repository are conversations with AI systems. AI systems:

- Are trained on human text and reflect human ideas
- May produce coherent-sounding but incorrect reasoning
- Cannot independently validate claims
- Are not peers in the scientific sense

## The Honest Position

We find this hypothesis compelling. We could be wrong.

The value is in the question, not the current answers. If you can falsify the hypothesis, that's progress. If you can strengthen it, that's also progress.

**Build your own calculator. Run your own game theory. Don't trust ours.**
