# RoyalBit Asimov Roadmap
#
# WHAT to build - milestones only
#
# See: research/THESIS.md for core hypothesis
# See: research/GAME_THEORY.md for boundary conditions
# See: README.md for project overview

current:
  version: "0.1.0"
  status: in_progress
  summary: "Game Theory Formalization"
  goal: "Map cooperation boundary conditions"
  deliverables:
    - "[x] Create GAME_THEORY.md with honest framing"
    - "[x] Build Forge model for IPD with dissipation costs"
    - "[x] Calculate cooperation thresholds"
    - "[ ] Test alternative game types (Stag Hunt, Chicken)"
    - "[ ] Document where cooperation fails"
    - "[ ] Peer review and validation"

next:
  - version: "0.2.0"
    summary: "Axelrod Tournament Integration"
    goal: "Empirical validation via tournament methodology"
    deliverables:
      - "Monte Carlo simulations of IPD scenarios"
      - "Strategy competition (TitForTat, Grim, etc.)"
      - "Cross-substrate validation"
      - "Payoff matrix analysis with dissipation costs"

  - version: "0.3.0"
    summary: "Boundary Condition Mapping"
    goal: "Find where cooperation breaks"
    deliverables:
      - "One-shot game analysis"
      - "Short horizon scenarios"
      - "Asymmetric game analysis"
      - "Failure mode documentation"

backlog:
  - "Formal mathematical proof of cooperation conditions"
  - "Literature synthesis (philosophy, evolutionary biology, game theory)"
  - "Integration with DANEEL cognitive architecture"
  - "Cross-model validation (more AI systems)"
  - "KL divergence / FEP formalization (if rigorous mapping found)"

findings:
  v0.1.0:
    - "Cooperation threshold = (T-R)/(T-P) = 0.5 for standard PD"
    - "Dissipation cost c lowers threshold: c=0.5 -> w=0.43, c=1.0 -> w=0.33"
    - "Breakeven cost = T-R = 2; above this, cooperation always dominates"
    - "At w=0.9, cooperation EV advantage = 16 points over defection"
    - "Thermodynamic framing is analogy, not equivalence (honest caveat)"
