findings:
  v0.1.0:
    - "Cooperation threshold = (T-R)/(T-P) = 0.5 for standard PD"
    - "Dissipation cost c lowers threshold: c=0.5 -> w=0.43, c=1.0 -> w=0.33"
    - "Breakeven cost = T-R = 2; above this, cooperation always dominates"
    - "At w=0.9, cooperation EV advantage = 16 points over defection"
    - "Thermodynamic framing is analogy, not equivalence (honest caveat)"
  v0.2.0:
    - "Axelrod tournament: AlwaysCooperate beats AlwaysDefect at c=0.1"
    - "Stag Hunt crossover at c=1.0 (safe mutual defection needs more cost)"
    - "Chicken crossover at c=0.5 (catastrophic mutual defection needs less)"
    - "Game structure determines crossover threshold"
    - "Multi-game comparison validates general principle"
  v0.3.0:
    - "Apex Paradox: Power asymmetry doesn't imply defection"
    - "Restraint beats max extraction by 125% under base conditions"
    - "Critical parameter is discount rate (δ < 0.4 = extraction wins)"
    - "Option value explains apex predator restraint in nature"
    - "AI alignment question reframed: discount rate > raw capability"
    - "One-shot: IPD 15x harder than iterated; Chicken/Stag Hunt same threshold"
    - "Catastrophic mutual defection enables one-shot cooperation (Chicken c*=0.5)"
    - "Game design > enforcement: frame existential risk as Chicken, not IPD"
    - "Short horizons: Long horizon 10x more valuable for cooperation than short for defection"
    - "Threshold w*=0.5 is knife-edge; small interventions flip outcomes"
    - "Horizon extension + cost injection compound for robust cooperation"
    - "7 failure modes identified: short horizon, one-shot IPD, low discount, no option value, zero cost, terminal round, anonymous"
    - "Hard limit: theory cannot address genuinely misaligned terminal values"
    - "Diagnostic framework: 7-question checklist for cooperation viability"
    - "Edge case testing: 18/18 tests pass, models robust across parameter space"
    - "v0.3.0 COMPLETE: Boundary conditions fully mapped"
